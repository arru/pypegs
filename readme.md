pyPEGS party shades Python utilities
====================================

Open source, platform agnostic utilites for the flashy PEGS LED sunglasses made by Infinite Reach (www.infinitereachsc.com). Finally a way to upload animations without a Windows computer, and designing animations using any GIF-outputting software of your choice!

This software was designed without consent from Infinite Reach, to move forward when the promised open-sourcing of their OEM software never materialized. IRSC, if you are reading this, do I have questions for you! Anyone else using this, I would love some feedback of your success or problems - and be aware that it's a sketchy piece of software since it was all designed from reverse engineering USB traffic with barely any specification.
