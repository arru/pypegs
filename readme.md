pyPEGS party shades Python utilities
====================================

Open source, platform agnostic utilites for the flashy PEGS LED sunglasses made by Infinite Reach (www.infinitereachsc.com). Finally a way to upload animations without a Windows computer, and designing animations using any GIF-outputting software of your choice!

This software was designed without consent from Infinite Reach, to move forward when the promised open-sourcing of their OEM software never materialized. IRSC, if you are reading this, do I have questions for you! Anyone else using this, I would love some feedback of your success or problems - and be aware that it's a sketchy piece of software since it was all designed from reverse engineering USB traffic with barely any specification.

__Please be aware that you are using this software at your own risk. There are possibilities of irreversibly damaging PEGS hardware from the use of this software.__

### Parts
1. `pypegs` module that handles conversion of animation data and communication with PEGS
1. script to upload animations from your computer into PEGS

Features
--------
* One-line upload script supports GIF animations (and PEGS designer .txt) files as input
* Heavily error-checking PEGS upload library
* Fully automatic serial port detection on POSIX systems
* Works on Mac OS X, and probably any other platform supporting Python and required libraries

upload.py usage
---------------
```
upload.py [-h] [-p PORT] [-f FPS] [--invert] [--test] slot file

Upload animations to PEGS party shades

positional arguments:
  slot                  Animation slot (1-8) to upload to
  file                  Input file (24x7 or 30x7 .gif, or glasses designer
                        .txt)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Use the serial port PORT instead of auto-connect
  -f FPS, --framerate FPS
                        Framerate in frames per second. Overrides any value
                        present in input file.
  --invert              Swap light/dark in animation
  --test                Run entire program through a dummy terminal instead of
                        hardware PEGS
```

Requirements
------------
* [Future Technology Devices International drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) (comes __pre-installed__ on Mac OSX 10.9 or later)
* External Python modules:
    * `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)
    * `bitstring`
    * `pyserial`
* PEGS shades B-)

Compatibility
-------------
Designed for and tested with PEGS party shades with firmware version 1.0.
